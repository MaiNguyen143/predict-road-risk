# predict-road-risk

**Project Overview**
Our team of four tackled a practical safety challenge:
Which road segments are most likely to experience accidents, and which interventions will have the greatest impact?

**Approach**
We integrated environmental, infrastructural, and temporal data to model accident risk at the road-segment level. An optimized Random Forest model was trained and validated to capture nonlinear relationships and interaction effects across features.

**Key Findings**

The model surfaced clear, actionable risk drivers, including:
- Curve severity
- Lighting conditions
- Weather patterns
- These factors consistently showed strong influence on accident likelihood.

**Impact**
The insights enable maintenance teams and policymakers to prioritize high-risk segments, select targeted interventions, and proactively reduce accidents and societal costs.

**Tools and Methods**
- Machine learning: Random Forest
- Feature domains: environmental, infrastructural, temporal
- Outcome: segment-level accident risk prediction

**Team**
- Project completed by a team of four, combining data science, analysis, and applied decision-making.
